          Remember that when you’re done…you’re not. You’ve got about 40% more
          left in the tank if you can just tap into that reserve. From what I’ve
          seen about this, the way that you do it is by practice. You keep
          reaching for more. You develop a calloused mind as Goggins calls it.
          This is done by spending a lot of time in the DIS-Comfort
          zone…physically and otherwise.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          By continually pushing yourself past your perceived limits, you will
          develop a new inner dialogue and confidence when encountering
          difficult physical challenges, allowing you to go beyond what you
          thought was previously possible.
